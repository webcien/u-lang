# Acknowledgements

U takes conceptual inspiration from several open source languages and tools:

- **Rust**: ownership model and memory safety.
- **Zig**: cross-compilation approach without dependencies.
- **Pony / Erlang**: actor-based concurrency and message passing.
- **Python**: readable and minimalist syntax.
- **LLVM**: compilation infrastructure (used optionally).

We thank these communities for advancing the state of the art in safe and efficient languages.

This project does not include code copied from any of them. All implementations are original, written from scratch under the MIT license.
