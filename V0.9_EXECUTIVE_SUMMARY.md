- Macro expansion engine with pattern matching
- Macro hygiene implementation
- 10 unit tests
- 2 macro examples

### Phase 5: Package Manager (Week 13)
**Effort**: 80 hours | **Priority**: P2 Medium

Launch a basic package manager and registry for dependency management and code sharing.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Package manager CLI (new, add, build, publish)
- Package registry integration
- Dependency resolution
- 5 unit tests
- Full documentation

## 📅 Timeline at a Glance

```
April:      Generic Traits Implementation
May:        Async/Await Runtime Development
June 1-16:  Platform Support (Android/iOS/WASM)
June 17-23: Macro System Implementation
June 24-30: Package Manager & Release
```

### Critical Path

1. **Week 3-6**: Generic traits must be complete for downstream features
2. **Week 7-9**: Async runtime must be stable before platform support
3. **Week 10-11**: Platform support must be tested on actual devices
4. **Week 12-13**: Macro system and package manager are sequential

## ⚠️ Key Risks & Mitigations

### High-Risk Items

**Risk 1: Async Runtime Complexity**
- Impact: High (blocks downstream features)
- Probability: Medium
- Mitigation: Early prototyping, daily standups, expert consultation

**Risk 2: Platform-Specific Issues**
- Impact: High (blocks mobile support)
- Probability: Medium
- Mitigation: Early device testing, dedicated platform engineer

**Risk 3: Time Pressure in Final Weeks**
- Impact: Medium (may defer features)
- Probability: Medium
- Mitigation: Prioritize package manager over macros, buffer time

**Risk 4: Performance Regressions**
- Impact: Medium (affects production use)
- Probability: Low
- Mitigation: Continuous benchmarking, performance tests

### Contingency Plans

If async runtime takes longer:
- Defer macro system to v0.10
- Extend timeline by 1-2 weeks
- Focus on core async functionality

If platform support encounters issues:
- Focus on Android first, defer iOS to v0.10
- Use existing build tools (Gradle, Xcode)
- Partner with platform experts

If macro system is too complex:
- Implement simplified version
- Defer advanced features to v0.10
- Prioritize package manager
